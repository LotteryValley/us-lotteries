## How It Works

Here's how Jackpot.com's courier service operates:

1. **Create Your Account** - Sign up at Jackpot.com with your email and verify your age and location.

2. **Choose Your Game** - Pick from the games available in your state, from national draws to state exclusives.

3. **Select Numbers** - Choose your own numbers or use Quick Pick for random selections.

4. **Complete Purchase** - Add funds to your account (use code VALLEYLOTTO for 1 free ticket on first deposit) and confirm your order.

5. **Get Your Ticket Scan** - Jackpot.com purchases your ticket from an authorized retailer and sends you a scanned copy of your physical ticket before the drawing. The original stays secured in their vault.

6. **Check Results Automatically** - Win notifications arrive by email or app. No more checking numbers manually.

7. **Claim Your Prize** - Small wins get deposited to your account. Large prizes? Jackpot.com delivers your ticket and assists with the claiming process at the lottery office.

## Fees and Pricing

Ticket prices match retail. A $2 Powerball ticket costs $2. Jackpot.com charges a 15% convenience fee on deposits, not individual tickets. Deposit $100, pay $15 total. Use that $100 to buy 50 tickets at $2 each.

No hidden charges. No fees on winnings. The 15% covers purchasing, scanning, secure storage, and customer support.

## Prize Claims

Prizes under $600 hit your account automatically. Check your balance and withdraw anytime.

Prizes over $600 require the physical ticket. Jackpot.com coordinates delivery and assists with lottery office visits. They've handled this process hundreds of times.

Tax forms arrive when needed. Federal law requires reporting wins over $600.

## Promo Code

New users get 1 free ticket (up to $5 in value) with code **VALLEYLOTTO** on their first deposit. Age restrictions apply by state. Standard service fees still charged on deposits. Limited time offer - check current terms.

## Location Verification

You must be physically located in your state when purchasing tickets. Jackpot.com uses GPS verification automatically. Traveling out of state? You can't buy tickets until you return, even if you're a resident.

This isn't a Jackpot.com policy decision. State law requires it. Every regulated courier service uses the same location checks to comply with state regulations.

## Games You Can't Play Online

Some games stay retail-only. Instant scratch-offs aren't available in all states (though Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Ohio do offer digital versions). Second-chance drawings might need manual entry.

Each state lottery decides what courier services can offer. These restrictions come from state regulations, not company policy.

## Why Use a Courier Service?

**Never Miss a Drawing** - Set up recurring purchases for your favorite numbers. Jackpot.com buys tickets automatically.

**Automatic Checking** - Results come to you. No more comparing numbers or losing tickets.

**Secure Storage** - Your tickets live in a vault instead of your junk drawer or car glovebox.

**Prize Assistance** - Claiming large prizes involves paperwork and appointments. Jackpot.com's team has guided this process hundreds of times and walks you through each step.

**Play Anywhere** - Buy tickets from your couch, office, or vacation rental as long as you're physically in state.

## National Games

Powerball and Mega Millions are available across all seven states. These multi-state games create the enormous jackpots you see in headlines.

Cash4Life operates in New York and New Jersey, offering a "win $1,000 a day for life" top prize.

Lucky for Life runs in Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Ohio with a similar lifetime prize structure.

## Getting Started

Visit [Lottery Valley's Play Online page](https://www.lotteryvalley.com/play-online) to choose your state. Each state page lists available games with current jackpots and next drawing times.
